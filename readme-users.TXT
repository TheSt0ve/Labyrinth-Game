Objective
The objective of the game is very simple. As the player, you control the light-blue ball that spawns 
at the beginning of the level. The goal is to tilt the maze itself such that the ball rolls through it.
Avoid the pitfalls or else you have to start over! The end goal is the orange platform at the top-left corner.

Controls
Tilt Level: WASD / arrow keys / joystick on an XBox or Playstation controller
Pause Game: Escape key / Start on an XBox or Playstation controller

Features
In the pause menu, the "Resume" and "Restart Level" buttons work as one would expect. As of this version, 
the "Quit to Menu" button is currently not implemented and simply unpauses the game, just like the resume button.
