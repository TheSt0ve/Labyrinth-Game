- In order to run a Unity game, an extra file is required called "UnityPlayer.dll" and because this file is too large for a file upload, it is not currently present. Therefore, if you wish to try the game out, please e-mail me at steven.a.johnson7@gmail.com and I will send the file to you through other means.

- Other than that,the game is already compiled and built within Unity, meaning it's ready to be played by running the corresponding executable.
- The executable is found by navigating as follows: 
	team06 > Build > CS4053-Project.exe
